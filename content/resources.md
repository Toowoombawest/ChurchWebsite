### BAPTISM

Baptisms are performed at our regular Sunday services.

If you or a member of your family would like to be baptised, we'd love to talk to you about the process.

As a part of the process leading up to Baptism we would ask that you attend a church service and a preparation meeting following the service on the first Sunday of the month (Unless otherwise arranged with the Parish Priest). This is a meeting when the priest or priest's representative will take you through the details of the celebration.

​As a part of organising your Baptism you will need to think about who you want to have as sponsors or godparents. Normally three godparents are chosen. Two are of the same gender as the child. However, two or four godparents can be chosen. There is a requirement that the godparents be baptised Christians. This is because they are making a promise and a commitment for the child to be a member of the Church and to believe the Christian faith. However, they do not necessarily have to be members of the Anglican Church. If, however, the Godparents you would like are not baptised you may like to invite them to consider baptism for themselves.

Costs

There is no fee for a baptism conducted during a service. It is a privilege and a pleasure for us to be able to offer this sacrament. If you wish, however, to make a donation, you may put it in the offering plate that is circulated during the service or give it to the priest who takes your baptism service.

Should you wish to have a baptism service outside regular services, a fee is incurred. Please discuss this with the priest.

To Make an Enquiry

If you have any questions or would like to organise a Baptism please contact the Parish Office on (07) 4638 5521. Rev Pauline will be only to happy to speak to you and help your organise this special occasion.


### Funeral

If you are on this page because you have just lost a loved one, we are so sorry. Please accept our sympathies. We hope that is some way we may be able to assist you at this time.

​

Jesus says in the Gospel of John:

Let not your hearts be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me. In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also. And you know the way to where I am going." Thomas said to him, "Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?" Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'

​

At Toowoomba West we offer a dignified, respectful and caring approach during these upsetting times as people grieve and work through the loss of a loved one. Our hope for you at this time is that through Jesus you will indeed be a comfort and your hearts will not be troubled.

​

Should you require any assistance please do not hesitate to call us.

### Wedding

The Anglican Church at Toowoomba West can offer you a Christian celebration of your wedding that will become a joyful memory that lives on in your married life together.

 

The parish extend a warm welcome to all visitors to discover the beauty of St Alban’s Newtown and St Augustine’s Rockville and we very much look forward to working with you in planning a personalised service that aligns both to Anglican traditions and your wishes.

​
What you need to do:

Contact by e-mail admin@toowoombawest.org to arrange an appointment or the Parish Office on (07) 4638 5521 to leave a message.

​
Make an appointment to discuss the required documents. Bring original copies of your full birth certificates, also evidence of baptism (for at least one of you). If either of you were born outside of Australia a passport will suffice if you have no birth certificate.

​

Federal Government also requires to know the full names of your parents, and your mother's maiden name, and the country where they were born. If either of you were born outside Australia the government wants to know how many years or months you have been in the country. You will also need to have the full names of your witnesses; the Best Man and the Principal Bridesmaid/Matron of Honour.

​

Documentation must be submitted to the appropriate government agency no later than one month and one day before the ceremony can take place.

​

At the first meeting you be given a copy of the order of service and be taken through the details of the ceremony. Also a selection of bible readings, advice on music, and a guide to planning your wedding booklet. A date is also fixed for a rehearsal for all those involved in the ceremony.

​

If either of you have been divorced, you will need to bring the court documentation. In these situations, permission from the Bishop has to be granted before the wedding can take place. A Priest will guide on this matter.

​
### Wedding Preparation

A Christian marriage has, at its heart, vows pledging a life-long commitment.

​

We want to ensure that your marriage begins on a solid foundation that will take you through the years ahead in a journey of trust, loyalty, support and deepening love. We therefore ask all couples to have some form of accredited marriage preparation for this journey of life. We recommend that you consider Prepare and Enrich. 

​

The other reason for marriage preparation is the difficulty in holding a marriage together with stress and problems. The very high divorce rate in our nation is evidence of this difficulty. Behind the statistics are unpleasant court procedures, financial hardship, along with confusion and deep hurt. Marriage preparation will not eliminate problems, but it will guide you on how to face them together in trust and mutual support.

​

Please contact the Parish Office on (07) 4638 5521 for more information.

Our Priest or appropriate person will be only too happy to help you organise these special events.

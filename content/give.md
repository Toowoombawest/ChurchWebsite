**How to Give in These Troubled Times,**

**A letter from Rev. Pauline**

To Our Supporters of Toowoomba West Anglican Parish. Many of you have made contact re. parish giving.
The best way in which you can help your church is to continue to give.
This may mean switching to online banking or direct banking. 
Bank details are as follows: 
**Banking details:    BSB 704 901   Account no 00001310**
An easier alternative is to Click the link below for direct link via ANFIN, the
Diocese financial department.Your offering goes through ANFIN but is immediately deposited into our Toowoomba West account, so your contribution makes a difference.

For those who wish to still give by your envelopes could you please email us
back so as we can make arrangements for collection of these. 
Members of the church deliver the weekly Pew sheet, reading and sermon
and other material to the folk not connected to the internet.
The plan would be for them to collect your envelopes from the areas
in which they deliver to.

​We have been working hard at revising our budget and we are looking
at ways in which to either defer payments and/or save in many areas.
Parish Council is still meeting on the 4th Monday of each month via Zoom,
making decisions to guide us through these difficult times.

​We thank you for your ongoing support during this time of crisis.
PLEASE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT YOUR CHURCH

​Blessings 
Pauline

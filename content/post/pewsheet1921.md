#### Sentence

> Blessed are you when people hate you on account of the Son of man. Rejoice and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven. 

#### Prayer of the Day

> Righteous God, you challenge the powers that rule this world and you show favour to the oppressed: instil in us a true sense of justice, that we may discern the signs of your kingdom and strive for right to prevail; for the sake of   Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever.   Amen

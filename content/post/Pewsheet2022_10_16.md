#### Prayer of the Day

> Lord, tireless guardian of your people, teach us to rely, day and night, on your care. Drive us to seek your justice and your help, and support our prayer lest we grow weary, for in you alone is our strength. We make our prayer through your Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen

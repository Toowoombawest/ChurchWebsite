> Watch and be ready, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming.                                 


#### Prayer of the Day

> Kindle in our hearts, Father, the same faith that impelled Abraham to set out from this home and to live as a pilgrim in a foreign land. As we, like him, look for the city that none but you can design and build, keep us watchful for your Son’s coming, that we may be found faithful stewards of all that you have entrusted to us.  We ask this through Jesus Christ our Lord.    Amen

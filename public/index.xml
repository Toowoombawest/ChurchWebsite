      <description>Here are some of the Pastoral services that the church can offer BAPTISM  Baptisms are performed at our regular Sunday services.
If you or a member of your family would like to be baptised, we&amp;rsquo;d love to talk to you about the process.
As a part of the process leading up to Baptism we would ask that you attend a church service and a preparation meeting following the service on the first Sunday of the month (Unless otherwise arranged with the Parish Priest).</description>

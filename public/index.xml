      <description>Sentence  Who shall stand in the Lord’s holy place? Those who have clean hands and pure hearts, who do not lift up their hands to what is false. Psalm 23: 3 - 4
 Prayer of the Day  Eternal God, open our eyes to see your hand at work in the splendour of creation and in the beauty of human life. Help us to cherish the gifts that surround us, to share our blessings with our sisters and brothers, and to experience the joy of life in your presence; through Jesus Christ, our Lord, who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever.</description>

      <description>Sentence  Of Jesus many said, ‘What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by his hands!’ mark 6:2
 Prayer of the Day  O Lord our God, you are always more ready to bestow your good gifts upon us than we are to seek them; and more willing to give than we desire or deserve: in our every need, grant us the first and best of all your gifts, the Spirit who makes us your children.</description>

      <description>Sentence  The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning; great is your faithfulness

 Prayer of the Day  Bountiful God, to whose glory we celebrate the dedication of this house of prayer: we praise you for the many blessings you have given to those who worship here, and we pray that all who seek you in this place may find you, and being filled with the Holy Spirit may become a living temple acceptable to you, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</description>

      <description>Here are some of the Pastoral services that the church can offer BAPTISM  Baptisms are performed at our regular Sunday services.
If you or a member of your family would like to be baptised, we&amp;rsquo;d love to talk to you about the process.
As a part of the process leading up to Baptism we would ask that you attend a church service and a preparation meeting following the service on the first Sunday of the month (Unless otherwise arranged with the Parish Priest).</description>
